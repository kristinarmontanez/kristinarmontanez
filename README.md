Hi there! I'm an attorney with a passion for technology and innovation. 
With my background in computer science, I have a unique perspective on the legal aspects of software development, database and web development and maintenance, and cloud application development. 

When I'm not doing work, you'll find me hanging out with my dogs, or reading sci-fi fantasy fiction. If you have a nerdy side to you and love pop culture references, we will get along just fine!

I'm always looking for new opportunities to collaborate with others in the legal and technical communities. If you have a project you'd like to work on together, feel free to get in touch!
